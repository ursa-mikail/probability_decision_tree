# Probability Decision Tree

This project generates a decision tree based on random decisions and their corresponding probabilities and gains/losses. It calculates statistical expectations for each decision, highlights the decision with the maximal gain in yellow, and the decision with the minimal loss in red. The tree is visualized using the Graphviz library.

## Features
- Generates random decision trees with probabilities and gains/losses.
- Calculates the statistical expectation for each decision.
- Highlights the optimal decision with maximal gain in yellow and minimal loss in red.
- Outputs the decision tree as a PNG file.
- Prints all expectation values in the console.
